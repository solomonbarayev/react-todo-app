# React To-do App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This app gives you the ability to add todos to a list. It uses React Hooks to data management to make stateful components as well as useHooks and useRef.

Every task can be edited, and checkmarked when completed. If you wish, you may also simply delete the task from the list altogether.

App is fully responsive on mobile screens and reactive to different states.

### Future Implementations:
 - add categories
 - add priority levels
 - enable drag and drop to switch order of tasks
